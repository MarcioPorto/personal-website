# Personal Website

This is the repo for my [personal website](http://marcioporto.com). It is built as a single-page application using Angular 5.

To serve website, run:

```
ng serve
```

To deploy:

```
ng build --prod --base-href="http://marcioporto.com"
angular-cli-ghpages
```

Then change GH settings.
