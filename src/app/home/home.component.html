<h3>Background</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  I graduated from <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/" target="_blank">Macalester College</a> in May 2017 with a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science.
  Since then, I have been following my interest in Artificial Intelligence by taking two Udacity nanodegrees: Deep Learning Foundations and Machine Learning Engineer (in progress). I am passionate about solving challenging problems through software. I am also very interested in cryptocurrencies, and truly believe in their potential to change the way that we do almost everything.
